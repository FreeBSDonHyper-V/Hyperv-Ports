.Nd Hyper-V Key Value Pair Driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
The \fBhv_kvp driver\fP provides the ability to store, retrieve, modify and delete 
Key Value pairs for FreeBSD guest partitions running on Hyper-V.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Hyper-V allows administrators to store custom metadata in the form
of Key Value pairs inside the FreeBSD guest partition. Administrators can
use Windows Powershell scripts to add, read, modify and delete such
Key Value pairs.

The driver is bare bones and merely forwards requests to its counterpart
user mode daemon - \fBhv_kvp_daemon\fP. The daemon maintains pools of Key Value
pairs and does the actual metadata management.

The same driver and daemon combination are also used to set and get
IP addresses from a FreeBSD guest. 

The set functionality is particularly
useful when the FreeBSD guest is assigned a static IP address and is failed
over from one Hyper-V host to another. After failover, Hyper-V uses the set IP
functionality to automatically
update the FreeBSD guest's IP address to its original static value. 

On the other hand, the get IP functionality is used to update the guest IP
address in the Hyper-V management console window.
