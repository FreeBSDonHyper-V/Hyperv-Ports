NAME
     hv-kvp -- Hyper-V KVP Integration Components

SYNOPSIS
     The hv-kvp provision a collection of kernel mode drivers and services
     that enhance FreeBSD guest experience on Hyper-V.


DESCRIPTION
     The Hyper-V Integration Components include drivers and services that
     improve functionality and performance of a FreeBSD guest operating system
     running on Hyper-V. As of this writing, the hv-kvp ports package
     installs the following binaries:

     a) hv_utils.ko - This is a loadable kernel module that provides FreeBSD
     guests with timekeeping, heartbeat, console shutdown and key-value pair
     functionality. This module is located under /boot/kernel/.

     b) hv_kvp_daemon - This is a user mode daemon that communicates with the
     hv_utils driver to manage user configurable metadata in the form of key
     value pairs.  This daemon also allows the system administrator to read
     and set IP addresses assigned to a FreeBSD guest. The daemon utilizes the
     following collection of scripts stored under /usr/local/hyperv/scripts:
     hv_get_dhcp_info
     hv_get_dns_info
     hv_set_ifconfig

     The daemon is located under /usr/sbin/. The corresponding daemon script
     named hv_kvpd is present under /etc/rc.d/.

PRE-REQUISITE
