.Sh NAME
.Nm hv_ata_pci_disengage
.Nd Hyper-V ATA PCI Disengage driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
The \fBhv_ata_pci_disengage\fP driver prevents the native FreeBSD ATA driver from 
loading in the presence of Hyper-V.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
FreeBSD guests running on Hyper-V can take advantage of the Hyper-V Storage
Virtual Consumer (\fBhv_storvsc\fP) for using their IDE devices. Since the ATA 
driver serves IDE devices as well, there is a chance that the ATA driver may
interfere with the operations of \fBhv_storvsc\fP. The \fBhv_ata_pci_disengage\fP 
driver avoids 
conflicts between the ATA driver and \fBhv_storvsc\fP by disabling the ATA driver 
when the FreeBSD guest is booting.

A side effect of disabling the ATA driver is that CDROM may become 
inoperational on FreeBSD guest partitions. If CDROM access is a must then 
users may use 
"set hw.ata.disk_enable=1" at boot time to prevent the ATA driver from being
disabled.
