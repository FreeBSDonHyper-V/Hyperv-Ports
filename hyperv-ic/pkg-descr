NAME
     hyperv-ic -- Hyper-V Integration Components

SYNOPSIS
     The hyperv-ic provision a collection of kernel mode drivers and services
     that enhance FreeBSD guest experience on Hyper-V.


DESCRIPTION
     The Hyper-V Integration Components include drivers and services that
     improve functionality and performance of a FreeBSD guest operating system
     running on Hyper-V. As of this writing, the hyperv-ic ports package
     installs the following binaries:

     a) hv_vmbus.ko - This is a loadable kernel module that provides a high
     performance communication interface between the FreeBSD guest partition
     and the Hyper-V root partition running Windows Server software. This mod-
     ule is located under /boot/kernel/.

     b) hv_storvsc.ko - This is a loadable kernel module that provides FreeBSD
     guests with optimized access to physical storage devices.  This module is
     located under /boot/kernel/.

     c) hv_netvsc.ko - This is a loadable kernel module that provides FreeBSD
     guests with optimized access to the physical network card.  This module
     is located under /boot/kernel/.

     d) hv_utils.ko - This is a loadable kernel module that provides FreeBSD
     guests with timekeeping, heartbeat, console shutdown and key-value pair
     functionality. This module is located under /boot/kernel/.

     e) hv_ata_pci_disengage.ko - This is a loadable kernel module that dis-
     ables the FreeBSD native ATA driver in order to avoid conflicts with the
     hv_storvsc driver. This module is located under /boot/kernel/.

     f) hv_kvp_daemon - This is a user mode daemon that communicates with the
     hv_utils driver to manage user configurable metadata in the form of key
     value pairs.  This daemon also allows the system administrator to read
     and set IP addresses assigned to a FreeBSD guest. The daemon utilizes the
     following collection of scripts stored under /usr/local/hyperv/scripts:
     hv_get_dhcp_info
     hv_get_dns_info
     hv_set_ifconfig

     The daemon is located under /usr/sbin/. The corresponding daemon script
     named hv_kvpd is present under /etc/rc.d/.

PRE-REQUISITE
     Before you install hyperv-ic ports, please ensure that you have added
     disk labels or UUIDs to all devices listed in fstab.

HISTORY
     Support for hyperv-ic ports was first released in September 2013. The
     ports were developed through a joint effort between Citrix Inc.,
     Microsoft Corp. and Network Appliance Inc..
