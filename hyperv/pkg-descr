Integration Components provide.

Driver support: 
FreeBSD Integration Services supports the network controller and the IDE and 
SCSI storage controllers that were developed specifically for Hyper-V.

Timesync: 
The clock inside the virtual machine will intially sync with the clock on the 
virtualization server in preparation for an external clock source

Integrated Shutdown: 
Virtual machines running FreeBSD can be shut down from either 
Hyper-V Manager or System Center Virtual Machine Manager by using the 
.Shut Down. command.

Heartbeat: 
Allows the virtualization server to detect whether the virtual machine is 
running and responsive.
